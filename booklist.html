		"The Book of Cold Cases" by Simone St. James follows a small-town woman who is a clinic receptionist by day, and a true-crime journalist by night. This humble city has been haunted for decades by the murder of a rich couple-- one homicide and one car crash-- and their daughter, the prime suspect, was never sentenced after the brutal trial. The journalist and the daughter are an unlikely friendship, but there are still secrets to be discovered that only they can uncover.

	  This popular mystery trilogy is one treasure where the second and third books are perhaps more iconic than the first one.  High-school senior Pippa Fitz-Amobi takes it upon herself to investigate a years-old murder long after it has been deemed a closed case. Her town is hiding more beneath the surface than she thought. The case's prime suspect, speculated to have committed suicide after the tragedy, may not have been the perpetrator after all. And his brother, still mourning the loss, catches Pippa's attention. Combining the best of mystery and romance, there is perhaps no better series more suitable for autumn.

		TJ Klune's heartwarmingly cosy trademark feel has made a splashing return in "The Lives of Puppets". In a post-singularity era, machines run the world at optimum efficiency after the eradication of humans. Where is the significance in being human when robots can think and operate at a higher level? The last human alive has been shielded from this dystopian society by his loving family of bots-- his father is a genius inventor and his sibling-like friends are a sadistic nurse and a fun-loving Roomba. When a foreign bot is revived in their isolated forest, the family's peace is disturbed... and a classically heartfelt coming-of-age journey ensues. TJ Klune's humorous writing style is sure to draw readers in to this book-- an ode to humanity in a world of machines.
